# Ruleset documentation
> How to write, edit, compile, and use a ruleset

If you wish to write your own ruleset or edit an existing ruleset, you can start by reading the [`Vanilla`](https://github.com/Aelto/tw3-a-gwent-empire/blob/master/compiler/Vanilla.ruleset) ruleset that comes pre-compiled with the mod.

### Variables
The syntax of a ruleset is relatively simple compared to what is generated by the compiler. It starts by storing the indices of the cards into variables, as the game recognizes the cards by their index (a number) it is often easier to declare a variable that points to the number so we can simply write `BlackArcher` instead of `235` later in the file.
Here is an example of how variables are declared:
```lua
variables {
  BlackArcher = 235,
  AnotherVariable = 100
}
```

### Factions
Once we've made our variables for easier writing, we can start declaring our factions. A faction is always composed of a group of leaders, a group of heroes and a group of units. During generation a deck is given a random leader, a random hero and multiple random units until all of its points are depleted.

A deck's quality is defined by two values: its `difficulty` and its `points`. The difficulty is what unlocks new cards, the higher it is the stronger the cards. The points controls how many cards the deck will have, in theory a deck with a high difficulty can have a low amount of points, resulting in strong cards in a limited amount.

Every time you define a card you can give it 3 additional values:
 - `count`: how many of them are available in the pool, higher count increases the chance for the card to be picked during generation

 - `cost`: the point cost of the card once it is picked

 - `difficulty`: the difficulty requirement for the card to appear, any player with a lower difficulty than what was entered won't get the card

Here is an example of how a faction is declared:
```lua
faction Skellige {
  leaders {
    1 King_bran_bronze,
    # available only if the player's difficulty is above 1000,
    # and if it is picked, it costs 2 points instead of 1
    1 King_bran_copper points(2) difficulty(1000)
  }

  heroes {
    1 CrachAnCraite,
    1 Hjalmar,
    1 Cock
  }

  units {
    1 Cerys difficulty(1000),
    1 Ermion difficulty(5000),
    1 Draig points(2),
    1 HolgerBlackhand,
    2 MadmanLugos,
    1 DonarAnHindar,
    1 Udalryk,

    2 Horn,
    # 2 more horns for higher difficulty opponents
    2 Horn points(2) difficulty(6000),

    1 Scorch points(2) difficulty(4000),
  }
}
```

### Compiling the ruleset
Once the ruleset is fully edited you can use the `age-compiler.exe` that is shipped with every release of the mod, drop it in the folder alongside the ruleset file and run the compiler (by double-clicking it). You should see a a mod folder being created, you can now install the mod folder by dropping it in your `The Witcher 3/mods` folder, then use the `agerulesetNameOfTheRuleset` command once in game where `NameOfTheRuleset` is the name of your ruleset file (excluding `.ruleset`)
